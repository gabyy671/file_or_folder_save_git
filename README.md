# Why using this

If you want to use git but you cannot have the folders / files in your git folder
(they are probably better tools to do it though)

# How to use
You just have to copy the bat file to your repo, then put the path of the file or the folder you want to save in the line 4

## For the pull
pull.bat will pull then copy the content in a folder (world in by default) to the one you put in the 4th line
